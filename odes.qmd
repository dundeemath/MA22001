ODEs are _ordinary differential equations_. These are equations which relate ordinary derivatives (not partial derivatives) of a function with each other. You've seen these many times before. Because they are ordinary derivatives, there is only one independent variable, which we typically call either $x$ (when talking about space) or $t$ (when talking about time). However, we can have more than one dependent variable.

Here are some famous examples:
$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{k}{m}x \quad\text{(Simple harmonic motion)}
$$
This describes, for example, a mass on a spring, or a pendulum undergoing small oscillations. The solutions are sinusoidal functions.

$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{\text{amb}}) \quad\text{(Newton's law of cooling)}
$$
This describes how an object cools down (or heats up) to the ambient temperature. The solution is an exponential decay (or growth) towards the ambient temperature.

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) \quad\text{(Logistic equation for population growth)}
$$
This describes how a population grows rapidly at first, then slows down as it approaches a maximum sustainable population $K$. The solution is an S-shaped curve called a logistic function.

The following is a 'system' of ODEs, meaning there are several dependent variables which depend on the same independent variable. Here, $x$, $y$ and $z$ all depend on the time $t$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \sigma(y - x) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x(\rho - z) - y \\
\frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - \beta z \quad\text{(Lorenz equations for convection)}
\end{aligned}
$$
This system is famous for exhibiting chaotic behaviour for certain values of the parameters $\sigma$, $\rho$ and $\beta$. It was originally derived as a simplified model of atmospheric convection.

## Linear and non-linear ODEs
An ODE is called _linear_ if the dependent variable(s) and all their derivatives appear to the first power only, and are not multiplied together. Of those above, the first two are linear, and the last two are non-linear.

In many cases, you can solve linear ODEs exactly, using methods you may have seen before. Non-linear ODEs are much harder to solve, and in many cases you can't find an exact solution at all. Instead, you have to use numerical methods to find approximate solutions.

It is important to be able to distinguish the two types, especially as we progress to PDEs.

## Constant coefficient ODEs
A linear ODE is said to have _constant coefficients_ if the coefficients (the numbers multiplying the dependent variable and its derivatives) are constants, not functions of the independent variable. For example, in the simple harmonic motion equation above, $k$ and $m$ are constants, so it has constant coefficients.
