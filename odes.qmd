ODEs are _ordinary differential equations_. These are equations which relate ordinary derivatives (not partial derivatives) of a function with each other. You've seen these many times before. Because they are ordinary derivatives, there is only one independent variable, which we typically call either $x$ (when talking about space) or $t$ (when talking about time). However, we can have more than one dependent variable.

Here are some famous examples:
$$
\ddd{x}{t} = -\frac{k}{m}x \quad\text{(Simple harmonic motion)}
$$
This describes, for example, a mass on a spring, or a pendulum undergoing small oscillations. The solutions are sinusoidal functions.

$$
\dd{T}{t} = -k(T - T_{\text{amb}}) \quad\text{(Newton's law of cooling)}
$$
This describes how an object cools down (or heats up) to the ambient temperature. The solution is an exponential decay (or growth) towards the ambient temperature.

$$
\dd{N}{t} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) \quad\text{(Logistic equation for population growth)}
$$
This describes how a population grows rapidly at first, then slows down as it approaches a maximum sustainable population $K$. The solution is an S-shaped curve called a logistic function.

The following is a 'system' of ODEs, meaning there are several dependent variables which depend on the same independent variable. Here, $x$, $y$ and $z$ all depend on the time $t$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dd{x}{t} &= \sigma(y - x) \\
\dd{y}{t} &= x(\rho - z) - y \\
\dd{z}{t} &= xy - \beta z \quad\text{(Lorenz equations for convection)}
\end{aligned}
$$
This system is famous for exhibiting chaotic behaviour for certain values of the parameters $\sigma$, $\rho$ and $\beta$. It was originally derived as a simplified model of atmospheric convection.

## Linear and non-linear ODEs
An ODE is called _linear_ if the dependent variable(s) and all their derivatives appear to the first power only, and are not multiplied together. Of those above, the first two are linear, and the last two are non-linear.

In many cases, you can solve linear ODEs exactly, using methods you may have seen before. Non-linear ODEs are much harder to solve, and in many cases you can't find an exact solution at all. Instead, you have to use numerical methods to find approximate solutions.

It is important to be able to distinguish the two types, especially as we progress to PDEs.

## Constant coefficient ODEs
A linear ODE is said to have _constant coefficients_ if the coefficients (the numbers multiplying the dependent variable and its derivatives) are constants, not functions of the independent variable. For example, in the simple harmonic motion equation above, $k$ and $m$ are constants, so it has constant coefficients.

A general first order linear, _homogeneous_ ODE with constant coefficients has the form
$$
a\dd{y}{x} + by = 0,
$$
and this has the solution
$$
y(x) = C e^{-\frac{b}{a}x}, 
$$
where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.

A general second order linear, homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients has the form
$$
a\ddd{y}{x} + b\dd{y}{x} + cy = 0,
$$
and this has the solution
$$
y(x) = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x},
$$
where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary constants, and $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots of the characteristic equation
$$
ar^2 + br + c = 0.
$$
which may be real or complex.

Notice the exponentials in both cases. If in doubt, try an exponential function as a solution!

This stuff shouldn't be new to you, but we'll see it a lot when we're solving more complicated equations, so it's worth making sure you understand it.

## Existence and uniqueness of solutions
When we turn to PDEs, it becomes very important to know whether a given equation has a solution, and whether that solution is unique. For ODEs, and especially for those second order, constant coefficient ODEs, there are well-established theorems that give conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions.

It is important, however, to think about what boundary or initial conditions you need to specify in order to get a unique solution. For example, for a second order ODE, you typically need to specify two conditions, such specifying both the value of the function and its first derivative at a particular point, but this may not always be the case.

For example, consider the equation
$$
\ddd{y}{x} + \dd{y}{x} = 0.
$$
This is a second order ODE, so we need two conditions to specify a unique solution.

The general solution to this ODE is
$$
y(x) = C_1 + C_2 e^{-x},
$$
where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary constants.

If we specify
$$
y(0) = 1, \quad \dd{y}{x}(0) = -1,
$$
then we find the unique solution
$$
y(x) = 1 - e^{-x}.
$$

However, if we instead specify that
$$
\dd{y}{x}(0) = -1, \quad \ddd{y}{x}(0) = 1,
$$
then we can have any solution of the form
$$
y(x) = C_1 + e^{-x},
$$
where $C_1$ can be any constant. Thus, the solution is not unique in this case.

On the other hand, if we specify
$$
\dd{y}{x}(0) = -1, \quad \ddd{y}{x}(0) = -1,
$$
then there is no solution that satisfies both conditions, so in this case a solution does not exist.

I won't ever ask you to solve an equation that has no solution, though I might ask you to identify when this is the case.

### Example
For the linear ODE
$$ 
\ddd{y}{x} = -y,
$$ 
subject to the boundary conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 1$ for some constant $L$, find a solution and show that it is unique.

## Solution
We can guess a solution to this ODE
$$
y(x) = sin(x),
$$
which satisfies the ODE and the boundary conditions. 

To show that this solution is unique, suppose there is another solution $y_2(x)$ that also satisfies the ODE and the boundary conditions. Then the difference $v(x) = y(x) - y_2(x)$ satisfies the ODE
$$
\ddd{v}{x} = -v,
$$
with the boundary conditions $v(0) = y(0) - y_2(0) = 0$ and $v'(0) = y'(0) - y_2'(0) = 0$.

The general solution to this ODE is
$$
v(x) = C_1 \sin(x) + C_2 \cos(x),
$$
where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary constants. Applying the boundary conditions gives $C_1 = 0$ and $C_2 = 0$, so the only solution is the trivial solution $v(x) = 0$. Therefore, we have shown that $y(x) = y_2(x)$, and hence the solution is unique.
