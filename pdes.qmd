PDEs are _partial differential equations_. These are equations which relate partial derivatives of a function with each other. Unlike ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which involve ordinary derivatives with respect to a single independent variable, PDEs involve functions of multiple independent variables and their partial derivatives.

Two very famous examples of PDEs that are found in physics are the __Navier-Stokes equations__ (which describe fluid flow) 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \vv{u}}{\partial t} + (\vv{u}\cdot\nabla)\vv{u} &= -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \vv{u} + \vv{f},\\
\nabla \cdot \vv{u} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$  
and __Maxwell's equations__ (which describe electromagnetism):
$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \cdot \vv{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \quad\text{(Gauss's law)} \\
\nabla \cdot \vv{B} &= 0 \quad\text{(No magnetic monopoles)} \\
\nabla \times \vv{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vv{B}}{\partial t} \quad\text{(Faraday's law)} \\
\nabla \times \vv{B} &= \mu_0\left(\vv{J} + \epsilon_0\frac{\partial \vv{E}}{\partial t}\right) \quad\text{(Ampère-Maxwell law)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Each of these PDEs needs a whole module of its own, but we will see some very simple examples here.

### The heat equation
The one-dimensional _heat equation_^[Also called the _diffusion equation_] is
$$
\pd{u}{t} = \alpha \pdd{u}{x},
$$
where $u(x,t)$ is the temperature at position $x$ and time $t$, and $\alpha$ is a constant called the thermal diffusivity.

### The wave equation
The one-dimensional _wave equation_ is
$$
\pdd{u}{t} = c^2 \pdd{u}{x},
$$
where $u(x,t)$ is the displacement at position $x$ and time $t$, and $c$ is a constant representing the wave speed.

## Existence and uniqueness of solutions

## Numerical solutions
The main way that PDEs are solved in practice is using numerical methods. These involve discretizing the continuous variables (like space and time) into a grid, and then approximating the derivatives using finite differences or other techniques. This allows us to turn the PDE into a set of algebraic equations that can be solved using a computer.

This is how, for example, the weather is predicted, via simulations of the atmosphere using numerical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. It is also widely used in financial modelling, engineering simulations, and many other fields.

We won't actually see how to do this in this module, but it's important to know that this is how most PDEs are solved in practice. In your level 4 projects, you may well use numerical methods to solve PDEs related to your chosen topic.
