This part of the module deals with sets in 3D.^[And specifically, 'nice' sets which can be differentiated and integrated. We won't go too much into the mathematical details, but these are called _manifolds_. This excludes things like fractal sets.]

Sets are defined by _equalities_ and _inequalities_. The simplest type we will see are those sets which are defined only by inequalities and no equalities. For example, consider the set $S$ where
$$
x\geq 0.
$$
We haven't mentioned $y$ or $z$, so we assume they can take any values. Formally, we might write this as^[Read this as "S is the set of x y z in R three such that x is non-negative"]
$$
S = \{(x,y,z)\in\mathbf{R}^3\,|\,x\geq 0\}.
$$
This is an infinite volume, it's all the points on one side of the $y-z$ plane.

When we impose an inequality, we restrict a given set to a smaller region of the same dimension. If we instead we impose an equality, we reduce the dimension, as we shall see next time.

### Example
Describe the set
$$
A = \{(x,y,z)\in\mathbf{R}^3\,|\,x\geq 0,\,x^2+y^2+z^2\leq4\}.
$$

## Solution
This set is defined by two inequalities but no equalities, so it's a volume.

It's the half-ball of radius $2$ (because $2^2=4$), centred on the origin, lying in the positive $x$ region.

For the purposes of this module, it doesn't really matter if the inequalities are strict ($<$ or $>$) or non-strict ($\leq$ or $\geq$), the maths will end up the same.
